The answer to the title I would like to give is pain, that is to say, Phoenix means pain in the story. Overall, I think the heavy yet powerful pain comes from the three dimensions as follows.</p><h2 id="Dimension-1-Pain-of-Broken-Relationships"><a href="#Dimension-1-Pain-of-Broken-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="Dimension 1: Pain of Broken Relationships"></a>Dimension 1: Pain of Broken Relationships</h2><p>This is a story full of broken relationships. They can be found everywhere: between Victor and his father, between Victor and Thomas, between the characters and their inner selves. It is the journey that drives the plot, but through the flashbacks we learn about how they struggled but without good results, both in relationships between each other and with themselves, providing information of the characters’ history and explain their actions.</p><p>Victor had been alienated from his father for a long time, and loss of important people in one’s life certainly caused the identity crisis. So after the father-son relationship fell broken during Victor’s puberty, Victor’s immature self-identity broke, followed by his friendship with Thomas. Feeling deserted and lost, he turned to alcohol and violence, for temporary relief from peer-pressure, his father’s neglect, and his need to fit in. So when his father passed away, it comes as no surprise for me that he felt a genetic pain like a broken bone. In my view, that Victor’s father’s death shut the only door for Victor to fix his relationship with his father and with himself. The “bone” was already broken, announcing no more possibility for Victor to pick up the pieces and start anew.</p><p>As for Thomas, his world of relationship was already broken immediately after he was born. Growing up without parents, he is bound to be the marginalized. He had dreams and had the courage to realize them, but dreams broke too as he “broke his wings”, and he received relentless ridicule from people around. “<em>For a long time I was mad because I thought my dreams had lied to me.</em> “ So he just drowned himself in the fantasy of his stories. Actually I think Thomas is a reflection of the experience of the author himself in a sense, as the author, Sherman Alexie, transsferred to an all-white school where his peers bullied him simply for being interested in education as an Indigenous American during his childhood.</p><p>We human beings live in a society woven by relationships and relationships are a large part of ourselves. But in the story, not a relationship is unbroken, let alone healthy or uplifting. Obviously  it’s not simply some certain person or group that is to blame, but the whole society, more specifically, whoever brought poverty, loss of ethnic identity and marginalization.</p><h2 id="Dimension-2-Pain-of-Generational-Social-Alienation"><a href="#Dimension-2-Pain-of-Generational-Social-Alienation" class="headerlink" title="Dimension 2: Pain of Generational Social Alienation"></a>Dimension 2: Pain of Generational Social Alienation</h2><p>It’s not something novel to say that the Native Americans are on the edge of the society and suffer from social alienation. Victor’s father died ini his trailer and was found after a whole week only because of the stink! The Tribal Council can’t even afford a plane ticket and 100 dollors is the best they can offer. Everyone celebrates the Fourth of July, while Indians’ long-lost independence does not gain any attention. Ever since the Indian Remove Act came into effect, this sort of social alienation has been passing down from generation to generation.</p><p>Another painful thing is, apart from the extro-alienation, intro-alienation also exists widely among the Native American. As far as I know, storytelling is an integral part of indigenous cultures. It is a method in which cultural history is passed down and well-preserved. In addition, it is also used to address questions about morality and view of life and offer guidance to young people. This is true for many cultures and societies including Native Americans. But back in the story, Thomas was brought up by his grandmother and is indeed a warehouse full of stories. He’s reflecting a theme observed in Native American culture, the passing down of Native history through oral stories. But in the reservation, <em>nobody wants to be anywhere near him because of all those stories</em>. From the fact we can see that the Indigenous culture is marginalized and alienated in society, even in the reservation where the Indigenous culture is “relocated” in our view. People don’t really accept, or feel embarrassed and even ashamed of, their indigenous identity, and that leads to the widespread intro-alienation.</p><p>It’s not a single-generation issue, but a generational trauma. We know Victor’s father spent his final years in not the reservation but Phoenix, which I view as the alienation from his identity. The father’s behavior has a lasting influence on Victor and the intro-alienation passed from the father to the son. As the broken situation continues, this alienation system will still work and the alienation from both the outside and the inside will continuously pass down.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Victor was ashamed of himself. Whatever happened to the tribal ties, the sense of community? The only real thing he shared with anybody was a bottle and broken dreams.”</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="Dimension-3-Pain-of-Chanceless-Re-bonding"><a href="#Dimension-3-Pain-of-Chanceless-Re-bonding" class="headerlink" title="Dimension 3: Pain of Chanceless Re-bonding"></a>Dimension 3: Pain of Chanceless Re-bonding</h2><p>The story has an open ending. I’m not sure if it is my sadness that makes me draw the conclusion, but I do think the chance of re-bonding in any sense after they returned is nearly zero. As they part after their long journey, Victor gives one-half of his father’s ashes to Thomas, and both plan to return the ashes to the river at Spokane Falls. It seems like they eventually find new hope after journeying to Phoenix together.</p><p>But I find some clues for a hopeless ending. While driving through the deserts of Nevada, they see no forms of life except for a jackrabbit. But the jackrabbit immediately “suicided” itself, enhancing the sense of loneliness and impliying that the reservation will be as hopeless and lifeless as usual. And the seemingly rebounding between Victor and Thomas is also just the surface. Deep inside, they both know that their friendship will not resume, as Victor does not want to become an outcast by associating with Thomas, and Thomas only asked Victor to stop and listen to his storytelling “just once”, clearly he knows it too well.</p><p><em>Victor knew that Thomas would remain the crazy storyteller who talked to dogs and cars, who listened to the wind and pine trees. Victor knew that he couldn’t really be friends with Thomas, even after all that had happened. It was cruel but it was real.</em></p><p>Nothing broken can be rebound in the story since there’s no joint effort for the better and the socical environment remains unchanged. Just like Cathy the gymnast they met on the airplane, the temporary warmth and connection will “wave goodbye” sometime in the near future. As Victor said with deep meanings, <em>It’s too bad we can’t always be that way.</em></p><p>Within the 13 pages, I take on a journey bouncing from today to the past, to see how the two characters fix the broken puzzles. The story illustrates the interpretation and greater impact that can be caused by lack of human connection and companionship. Our relationships with others, whether friends or family, help make up who we are and play a very important role in how we communicate and connect with our society, as well as how we feel about ourselves. I know the intention of my teacher is to help us know more about the Native American better in a more sensory way, and I do feel the alienation from their indigeous identity and the blur they’re trapped in especially in terms of self-identification. But I feel much more than this, something beyond ethnic and culture, something more about empathy concerning and philosophical thoughts. I do not major in sociology or political science and I have no solution on how to fix the broken pieces and help them rebond with their identity. But there’s one thing I’m pretty sure, that the emotions and pain in the story are universal and everyone can feel them. If there are enough people who do feel the pain, then maybe things will take a turn for the better?</p><hr><p>PS: If you are interested in this story, click <a href="https://www.enl.auth.gr/files/Sherman_Alexie.pdf">here</a> to read it.</p>]]></content>
